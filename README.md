This is a challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/canal-street-market).
[The original website](https://canalstreet.market) is made by [Zero](https://www.zero.nyc).

Created with Next.Js, React, and TailwindCSS.

My duplication can be accessed [here](https://jaingam.github.io/canal-street-market/). As of December 2024, I have only completed the main page's design, excluding the initial animations and footer.
